This is a series of examples that I made in Angularjs.
I'm trying to advance in my carrer as a software engineer.
Why?
Well, I've been around seven years in the industry and things has changed.
First, in the early 2010's the companies requiered people fully enhanced
with native Android/iOS developers. The things was so preety well and all
was so straight. Later, in 2012 seems like there was a big boom with cross
platform tools and apps, so Cordova, and other framewors that could act as
a web page but calling native functions were in the scene. I've been then
strugling, because I couldn't stick to just a technology, so I decided better
be an algorithm designer and a UX/UI certified develper. So I did it.
Now it's 2016 and the industry whants you to be all these things:
-An UX/UI developer.
-With strong knowledge with webs technologies; first pure HTML5, Js & CSS3.
-With strong knowledge in Angularjs to manage a big ammount of data.
-If your managging data then you must have an approach to big data.
-knowledge in mobile application development.
-Has a great sense of humor, proactivity, tons of energy.
-2010 pay.
-So I need to survive too, if I became a Software Engineer in first place is for
the great job I could do. I'm passionate about that and eager to learn every
thing that is possible. I don't know were I lost the way, but I have to recover
it, because ain't gonna be young forever.
